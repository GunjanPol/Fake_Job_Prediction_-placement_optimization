In todayâ€™s competitive digital job market, verifying the authenticity of job listings and optimizing resumes for relevant opportunities are crucial challenges for both job seekers and recruiters.
Our project tackles these issues by developing an integrated web-based platform that combines fraudulent job post detection with resume optimization.
Using machine learning and generative AI, the platform classifies job postings as fraudulent or legitimate and provides tailored resume feedback for real job opportunities. 
By leveraging technologies like Naive Bayes for fraud detection and the Google Gemini API for resume matching, the platform enhances transparency in the job market and streamlines the recruitment process, benefiting both job seekers and recruiters.
